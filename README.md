# ClusterBan

ClusterBan identifies attacks and scans through a combination of log scanning, using the "Fail2Ban" Open-Source Software, and custom functionality similar to a "Honey-Pot".  When ClusterBan identifies a scanor an attack, it bans the source address throughout the entire cluster.

The initial bans of an IP address are temporary, but persistent attacks can be converted to permanent.

Because of its design, ClusterBan has the ability to block some zero-day attacks.  In addition, it can be configured to block DDoS attacks at the Load Balancer.

Current status - Initial design
